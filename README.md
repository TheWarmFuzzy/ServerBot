##About
ServerBot is a module based bot for chat program [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). Currently development is being done per request so there is no particular end goal functionality; however it is being developed to be flexible such as the addition of a module becomes easier with ever modification.

* Help

##Future Modules
_Implimentation of each module is not assured. Names may be subject to change._

* Music Player
	* Plays music in voice channels
* Storage
	* Adds a database so the bot can be stateful
* Puns
	* The bot tells puns, who knows when?
